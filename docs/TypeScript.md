# Why TypeScript

* It catches stupid bugs
* Sum types (for example `RemoteDataState` or `Option`) are very useful for modeling state machines (and opt-in flows).
* Interoperability and integrity guarantees
  * A breaking change is more likely to be caught at compilation time
* Autocomplete (for example in `<Translate>` component)
